# CURRENT

## Iteration 03

 * Start date: Tuesday, July 11, 2023
 * End date: Friday, July 21, 2023

## Process

#### Changes from previous iteration

We are happy with our decisions from previous iterations. The most significant process decisions we made were:
* Breaking user stories down into smaller tasks. This has allowed us to get a lot more done, as each small subtask doesn’t take that long, but feels rewarding to complete. Compared to in sprint 1, when we hadn’t done this, we have managed to accomplish a lot more due to this decision.
* Having coding sessions together. This allowed us to work more efficiently, as oftentimes when one person had an issue, someone else easily helped to resolve the issue. It was very successful, as many issues that could have taken one person many hours to complete were completed within minutes with the help of others

## Product

#### Goals and tasks

 * Our goal for this sprint is to introduce calendar functionality, and refine messaging and video calling functionalities. We will achieve this by doing the following tasks:
* Allow users to view a timer for the duration of a video conference  (user story 17)
* Allow users to join and leave group chats (user story 7)
* Allow users to edit and delete text messages that they have sent (user story 10)
* Allow users in a group to see who has read their messages (user story 14)
* Allow users in a group to reply to messages sent by anyone (user story 11)
* Allow users to see the timestamp of any messages that have been sent (user story 13)
* Build a functional calendar component where users can add and remove events (user story 18)

#### Artifacts

* Calendar interface: build a calendar page where users can add and view events for each week. Users can add and modify times and names for each event
* Video calling: image of timestamp during a video call
* Chatting: images of deleting messages, joining groups, read receipts, replies, and timestamps
