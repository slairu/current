# Current: Sprint 2 Review


### Iteration 2 - Review & Retrospect

 * When: July 3, 2023
 * Where: Online

## Process - Reflection

### Decisions that turned out well

#### Splitting up tasks
Explanation:
- Dividing tasks into frontend and backends separately allows us to focus on our own speciality. By dividing tasks in this manner, the team could achieve greater efficiency and productivity. It also allows scalability on each individual component in the future.

Artifact:
- Task breakdown on Jira

#### Working on different features in parallel
Working on different features simultaneously led to independent tasks, increased productivity, and faster development. We are able to deliver multiple functioning features within the sprint and achieve significant progress.

### Decisions that did not turn out as well as we hoped

#### Dividing user stories into too many sub-tasks
Explanation:
- The splitting of tasks in one user story requires frequent communication between teammates working on them. The constant going back and forth can slow down the development process and increase the chances of miscommunication or misunderstandings. Instead of promoting productivity, this decision might have resulted in delays, inefficiencies, and a lack of focus on the larger picture of the user story. 

#### Using Chat Engine library
Explanation:
- Using the Chat Engine library initially appeared convenient for quick chat implementation, but its lack of scalability and extensibility became a significant drawback. As the project progressed, the library's limitations hindered the addition of desired features and handling increased user traffic, making it a regrettable decision in retrospect.

#### Planned changes

#### Daily Stand-up Meetings:
- Conduct daily stand-up meetings where the entire team gathers to share progress updates, discuss challenges, and communicate plans for the day. These short and focused meetings allow team members to align their efforts, identify potential roadblocks, and seek help if needed.

#### Create a Positive Team Culture
Explanation:
- Foster a positive and supportive team culture where team members feel comfortable expressing their thoughts, asking for help, and sharing ideas without fear of judgment. A positive team environment encourages open communication and fosters trust among team members.

## Product - Review

#### Goals and/or tasks that were met/completed:

##### Video conferencing component
We have successfully added a new feature to the original video call component, which allows users to keep track of the duration of the call. The functionality was tested for reliability and usability, and it meets the requirements specified in the user stories.

##### Chat page front end
We have implemented a chat page front end that allows attaching media and urls in chat. Additionally, it allows users to view previous media in the chat easily.

##### User profile setting front end
The user profile setting front end allows users to update their user name and phone number.

#### Goals and/or tasks that were planned but not met/completed:

We did not have any tasks planned but incomplete

## Meeting Highlights

Going into the next iteration, our main insights are:

- we plan to have coding sessions together to boost our efficiency and communication. By doing so, we can readily assist each other when facing challenges, enabling us to resolve issues swiftly. We anticipate that this collaborative approach will allow us to accomplish tasks that would have otherwise taken hours in a matter of minutes with the collective support of the team.

- During the standup meetings, team members can provide support and suggest ways to overcome the identified blockers. This collaborative problem-solving approach empowers the team to pool their diverse perspectives and expertise, leading to innovative solutions. Additionally, discussing blockers in a group setting encourages knowledge sharing and cross-functional learning, as team members may offer insights from their own experiences and areas of expertise.
