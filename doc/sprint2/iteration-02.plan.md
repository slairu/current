# Current

## Iteration 02

 * Start date: Tuesday, June 27, 2023
 * End date: Friday, July 7, 2023

## Process

#### Changes from previous iteration

 * Breaking down user stories into smaller tasks. This will allow us to assign people specific tasks to take on, since each user story by itself is a lot of work. We will know that this change is successful if we complete more story points than last sprint.
 * Having coding sessions where members of the team work together on specific tasks. Members will be able to ask each other questions, review each otherâ€™s code, and assist each other if they need help. We will know that this change is effective if we complete more story points than last sprint.

## Product

#### Goals and tasks

 * Our goal for this sprint is to introduce messaging capabilities, allow users to add/remove members to their own chats, and create the account settings page. We will achieve this by doing the following tasks:
* Build a functional messaging component where users can send/receive messages from/to anyone they add to chat  (user story 8 and 9)
* Build a functional account settings page with capability to update username and/or password (user story 5)

#### Artifacts

* Chat interface: build a page for chat. Users can enter the specific chat room. Users can send messages and files in the chat room.
* User settings page: build page for setting user information. Users can modify their username, password, and bio.
