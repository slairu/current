#### Goals and tasks

Â * Our goal for this sprint is to create the sign-up and login pages, set up the accounts and authorization on the backend, and begin work on the main component of our project, the video calling feature. We will achieve this by doing the following tasks:

* Build a functional video-calling component where users can turn on and off their camera and microphone

* Build a front end for homepage where users can access different pages of the application

* Build a functional sign in page with basic sign in and account management features (user story 1 and 2)

* Make sure that the video-calling requires the user to be signed in

#### Artifacts
