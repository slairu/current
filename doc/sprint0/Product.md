#### Q1: What are you planning to build?

We are planning to build a video conferencing web app that allows users to seamlessly connect with each other through video calls, share their calendars to see each other's availability, and communicate through messaging at any time.

The problem we are solving is the need for efficient and effective communication in both personal and professional settings. Currently, users have to rely on multiple platforms and tools for video calls, calendar sharing, and messaging, leading to fragmentation and inconvenience. Our product aims to bring these essential communication functions together in a single, user-friendly web app.

The product will be a web application accessible through browsers on desktop and mobile devices. Users will be able to create accounts, log in, and utilize the various features offered by the platform.

1. Professional Meetings: Professionals can schedule and join video conferences with colleagues, clients, or partners, view each other's availability through shared calendars, and have the option to communicate through messaging before, during, or after the meetings.

2. Remote Collaboration: Remote teams can easily connect and collaborate through video calls, ensuring smooth communication and coordination. Shared calendars enable team members to find suitable meeting times, while messaging features facilitate ongoing discussions and file sharing.

3. Personal Communication: Friends and family members can use the app for video calls, staying connected across distances. Shared calendars help coordinate schedules for virtual gatherings, while messaging allows for quick and casual conversations.

#### Q2: Who are your target users? (2-3 personas)

##### Persona 1: Sarah - The Professional

>Sarah is a marketing manager working for a global company. She frequently schedules meetings with team members, clients, and external partners. She needs a reliable video conferencing solution that integrates calendar sharing and messaging, allowing her to efficiently manage her schedule and collaborate effectively.

##### Persona 2: Mark - The Remote Worker

>Mark is a software developer who works remotely for a tech startup. He needs a platform that enables him to seamlessly connect with his team members, join video calls, and share his calendar availability. Messaging features are important for ongoing discussions and quick information exchange.

##### Persona 3: Lisa - The Social Connector

>Lisa is a university student who wants to stay connected with her friends and family members, despite being physically apart. She values the ability to have video calls, plan virtual events through shared calendars, and engage in casual messaging for day-to-day interactions.


#### Q3: Why would your users choose your product? What are they using today to solve their problem/need?

Our users would choose our product for several reasons:

1. Seamless Integration: Our web app brings together video conferencing, calendar sharing, and messaging in one cohesive platform. Users no longer need to switch between different applications or tools to communicate effectively.

2. Efficiency and Time Savings: By having access to shared calendars, users can easily find suitable meeting times without the back-and-forth of scheduling emails or messages. This saves time and streamlines the process of organizing meetings or events.

3. Improved Collaboration: With integrated messaging, users can have ongoing discussions related to their video calls or share important files and information. This ensures that collaboration continues beyond the video conferencing sessions, enhancing productivity and coordination.

Currently, users rely on a combination of separate tools for video conferencing, calendar management, and messaging. They might use platforms like Zoom or Microsoft Teams for video calls, Google Calendar for calendar sharing, and messaging apps like Slack or WhatsApp for communication. This fragmented approach leads to inefficiency and potential compatibility issues. Our product consolidates these functions into a unified, user-friendly solution.
 
#### Q4: What does "DONE" means to your Team 

For our team, "DONE" means that we have successfully implemented the core features of the video conferencing web app and they meet the following criteria:

1. Video Conferencing: Users can initiate, join, and participate in video calls with high-quality audio and video. 

2. Calendar Sharing: Users can connect their calendars to the app and easily view the availability of other users. They can schedule meetings, send invitations, and receive notifications for upcoming events. The calendar integration should be compatible with popular calendar platforms such as Google Calendar, Microsoft Outlook, and Apple Calendar.

3. Messaging: Users can engage in real-time messaging with other participants, both during video calls and outside of them. The messaging feature should support text-based communication, and notifications for new messages.

4. User Authentication and Account Management: Users can create accounts, log in securely, and manage their profiles. This includes features like password reset, profile settings, and the ability to connect with colleagues, friends, or family members.

To ensure the quality of our product, we will conduct thorough testing, bug fixing, and gather user feedback to make necessary improvements.

### Highlights


1. **Key Decision: Choosing Web App as the Platform**

During our initial discussions, we considered developing a mobile app instead of a web app. However, after analyzing our goals to be achieved, we realized that a web app would provide greater challenge and allow us to make use of what we learnt from lectures. Additionally, developing a web app allows users to easily access our services without the need to download and install a separate application.

2. **Key Decision: Choosing  to make a Video Conferencing Platform**

During our initial brainstorming sessions, we explored various product ideas, including the concept of a shared calendar application and a team organization tool. The shared calendar application aimed to provide users with the ability to check the availability of their friends or colleagues and coordinate shared plans. On the other hand, the team organization tool would enable users to communicate with each other while effectively managing and tracking tasks.

However, as we delved deeper into understanding the needs of our target users, we discovered a common pain point - the inconvenience and fragmentation of switching between multiple tools for calendar management and messaging. This insight led us to make a pivotal decision: integrating calendar sharing and messaging functionalities into our product.

By incorporating calendar sharing and messaging features, we are creating a unified and seamless experience for our users. They will be able to not only schedule meetings efficiently but also engage in ongoing communication within the same platform. This integration eliminates the need for users to juggle between different tools, resulting in a more streamlined and productive user experience.


3. **Key Decision: Using Jira to Organize our Team**

To facilitate our collaboration process, we adapted the Scrum development framework and took an iterative approach on our project. Our team decided to utilize Jira as a team management tool to track tasks, assign responsibilities, and monitor processes. During sprint #0, we held weekly meetings on Discord to stay connected and brainstorm on our product idea
