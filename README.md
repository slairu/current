**Description**

The motivation behind our project is to develop a comprehensive video conferencing web app that addresses the need for efficient and effective communication in both personal and professional settings. Our app aims to solve the problem of fragmentation and inconvenience caused by relying on multiple platforms and tools for video calls, calendar sharing, and messaging. By bringing together these essential communication functions into a single, user-friendly web app, we aim to streamline communication processes and enhance collaboration among users.

**Problem(s) Addressed**

The current communication landscape is characterized by the use of disparate tools and platforms for video conferencing, calendar management, and messaging. This fragmentation often leads to inefficiency, time wastage, and potential compatibility issues. Users have to switch between different applications, making it challenging to coordinate schedules, initiate video calls, and have ongoing discussions. Additionally, professionals, remote workers, and individuals seeking personal connections are all affected by these challenges.

Our project addresses these problems by providing a unified solution that integrates video conferencing, calendar sharing, and messaging functionalities. By consolidating these features into a single web app, users can seamlessly connect with others, view availability through shared calendars, and communicate effectively at any time.

**Why this app exists**

Choosing a video conferencing web app aligns with our team's existing expertise and knowledge. It allows us to leverage our understanding of web development, user interface design, and backend technologies to create a robust and user-friendly product. By capitalizing on our strengths, we increase the chances of delivering a high-quality solution. by eliminating the need to switch between multiple tools.

By integrating video conferencing, calendar sharing, and messaging, we aim to create a comprehensive solution that meets the diverse communication needs of our users.
